A sudoku solver I wrote while watching my sister and my mother solving
sudokus at the beaches of the northern shore on the island of
Porquerolles (theyâ€™re much better than the ones on the southern shore).

Usage: ./sudoku.rb <grid.sdk>

See directory grids for example of grids (all solved by the program).
